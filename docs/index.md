# Network Hacking with Python

This site and repo contains the groundwork and challenges for getting started with attack and exploiting network protocols with Python.

> NOTE: Remember, you are responsible with what you do with this knowledge. Always get permission to attack systems that don't belong to you and use this knowledge to help others. Don't use this for illegal activities!

The goal here is to get you familiar with lower-level networking with Python, working with unknown binary network protocols, and building attacks against them. It's expected you have some familiarity with Python, C, and basic networking concepts.

Note that this guide won't step you through everything you'll need to do, just point you in the right direction. Get your hacker-mind on and start with the challenges below:
